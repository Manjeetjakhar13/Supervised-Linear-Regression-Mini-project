# Dataset

Population of U.S. Cities

# Description

The bigcity data frame has 49 rows and 2 columns.
The measurements are the population (in 1000's) of 49 U.S. cities in 1920 and 1930. The 49 cities are a random sample taken
from the 196 largest cities in 1920.

# Format

This data frame contains the following columns:

u The 1920 population.

x The 1930 population.

# Exploring and Understanding Data (EDA)

# 1. Load required Libraries



# 2. Collect and load data



# 3. Explore numeric variables - five number summary



# 3a. Visualize numeric variables in boxplot and histograms
# 3b. Measure spread â€“ variance and standard deviation





# 4. Explore relationships between variables using scatterplots and two-way cross tabulations



# 5. Transform the dataset
Find the number of rows in given dataset and separate the input and target variables into X and Y. Hint: You can shape function 
to get the size of the dataframe



# 6. Check the dataset for any missing values and also print out the correlation matrix
You can use .isna() and .corr() functions to check NA's and correlation in the dataframe respectively



The high correlation betwwen u and x indicates that the variable u is a good predictor of variable x

# 7. Split data into train, test sets
Divide the data into training and test sets with 80-20 split using scikit-learn. Print the shapes of training and test feature 
sets.*
Check: train_test_split function



# 8. Find coefficients & intercept
Estimate the coefficients b0 and b1 using scikit-learn.
Check: coef_ and intercept_ functions can help you get coefficients & intercept



# 9.  Linear Relationship between feature and target
Plot the line with b1 and b0 as slope and y-intercept.



# 10. Evaluation of model with scikit-learn
Validate the model with Root Mean Squares error and R^2 score using scikit-learn. RMSE and R2 for test data and prediction

Hint: You can import mean_squared_error function & r2 (R square) from sklearn.metrics. Performing root operation over mean 
square error over mean square error gives you root mean square error



# 11. Calculate the accuracy of the model for both training and test data set

Hint: .score() function
